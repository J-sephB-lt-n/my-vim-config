My VIM configuration

I'm aware that [neovim](https://neovim.io/) is more trendy at the moment, but I'm happy with vanilla VIM for now. 
I'm taking a break from VS-Code (and all of the AI auto-completion stuff) in order to get better acquainted with the linux terminal.

My vim config is in [.vimrc](./.vimrc) - copy this file to ~/.vimrc on your computer in order to apply it to your local VIM. 

You can see how I use this config in my docker container for python development [here](https://github.com/J-sephB-lt-n/python-docker-container)
